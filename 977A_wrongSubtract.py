'''
Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:

if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;
if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit).
You are given an integer number 𝑛
. Tanya will subtract one from it 𝑘
 times. Your task is to print the result after all 𝑘
 subtractions.

It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integer numbers 𝑛
 and 𝑘
 (2≤𝑛≤109
, 1≤𝑘≤50
) — the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.

Output
Print one integer number — the result of the decreasing 𝑛
 by one 𝑘
 times.

It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.
